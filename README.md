> ### hODRL!

Keep the hordes at bay with Python execution of ODRL policies.

## Project structure

Subdirectory `hODLR` contains the Python client for ODRL policies, which can be used to control access to resources based on ODRL rules.

The top level contains a `docker-compose.yml` and configurations which provide a supporting environment for managing assets and permissions using the hORDL client.
